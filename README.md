## Background
A formatting tool, also known as a pretty-printer, prints the parser's AST of the corresponding language into a beautifully formatted string.


Currently, the community has been discussing the need for a formatting tool for the move language, but due to the fact that implementing a formatting tool is not an easy task, there has not yet been a mature and user-friendly formatting tool for the move language.


Based on this, MoveBit developed a move formatting tool for this purpose. It currently supports the formatting of Move code in Aptos Move projects.


## Build

**movefmt** requires Rust compiler to build. From the root directory, execute the following command.

```

Alternatively, you can easily use the vscode plugin **aptos-move-analyzer** by installing it. We have integrated **movefmt** into it, which allows you to format the current move file with just one right-click. The VScode plugin **aptos-move-analyzer** is installed on the plugin market page with detailed guidance.
